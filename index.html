			<h3>About Me:</h3>
				<p>I was born in Reno, NV in 1981 and moved between a wildlife refuge in souther Nevada and Reno. In 1989, my family moved to Idaho, which is where I went to primary school. After I graduated high school, I couldn't wait to leave, so I enrolled and attended college in Ashland, OR. In 2006, I decided I had had enough of Ashland and moved to Portland, OR. Currently, I live in North Portland with my wife and two dogs (Jasper and Wren).</p>
